You need to generate a third-party app password in gmail by:
1. Manage you account>Setup two-factor authentication.
2. Then go back to Manage your account, then Security>App Password. Then, select your device and third-party app for which you need password. And click on 'Generate'.

As per the new privacy policy of Google, from May 30,2022 it's no longer supporting the use of third-party apps or device which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.
